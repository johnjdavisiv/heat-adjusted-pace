# Calculate pace adjustments for running workouts in heat and humidity

>By John J. Davis

Front-end UI and back-end calculations for estimating a "heat-adjusted pace" for marathons and long workouts (for example, long tempo runs) in hot or humid conditions.  

Heat/humidity adjustments are calculated based on a statistical model fit to marathon performances from 3,891 runners competing in 754 different marathon events reported in [Mantzios et al., Med Sci Sports Exerc. 2022;54(1):151](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34652333/)
